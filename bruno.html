    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Mexico has over 85 million (65% of total population) internet users and out of those
        around 78 million people use mobile. Even after having such a huge number of internet
        users there are not many good online insurance providers in Mexico. Having not enough
        awareness about insurance products is a challenge in Mexican market, however things are
        changing at a faster pace. Our client saw a huge opportunity in this space, hence the
        birth of Bruno.
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Research and findings</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        We spent 5 days in Monterrey, a beautiful city which is a capital of Nuevo León.
        Monterrey is hi-tech and advanced in terms of infrastructure as compared to most
        of other Mexican cities.<br>
        We interviewed all the stakeholders (insurance experts) and 5 different users.
        Based on these interviews we find out that all insurers depend on their traditional
        sales force that is incentivised by commissions but not aligned with the user's needs.
        Users stick to the canned products that the market offers through traditional channels
        that partially respond to their risk profile. To be able to satisfy their needs,
        they have to go with different suppliers and do not always find all the coverages
        they require or end up buying coverages that more closely resemble what they need.

    <!-- <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Learnings</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        I had done a few projects related to physician appointment booking, queue management and others but Medo
        was much different and more complex project for me, where I got a chance to have a much deeper look into the Imaging world of healthcare industry.
        Doctor’s time and diagnosis accuracy have a paramount value in healthcare, this was the biggest learning for me.
        Little time wasted with fiddling interfaces can delay the patient’s report, which further can have a very unpleasant outcome.
