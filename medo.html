    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Medo is the platform which acts as an additional hand for radiologists by assisting them in diagnosing any
        possibilities of a medical condition by reading an ultrasound scan. Apart from AI predictions it also does few basic
        activities which a normal PACS (Picture Archiving and communication system) does like viewing DICOM images,
        basic editing, annotating, report preparation, image comparison and collaboration with teammates.
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">The challenge</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        I had a limited knowledge about imaging technologies like Ultrasound or MRI. I
        was curious about the world of Radiologists, their day to day life and challenges faced by them. It was a
        little intimidating but exciting at the same time. Our client helped us in setting up a few quick meetings with
        their Radiologists friends in Pune at their labs. The information we got from these meetings was immensely useful and
        helped us throughout the project.
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Goals</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        The major goals of the system were:
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>To simplify the image reading from ultrasound technology for common and critical conditions.</li>
            <li>User collaboration in complex cases. AI is great but there’s no substitute for human judgement. User should
                be able to seek the help of colleagues to reach on a better conclusion.</li>
            <li>To generate a report for patients, so that software can be commercialized.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Getting along with users</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Our visit to Radiology lab helped us in observing their work environment closely. We spent half a day there
        in Pune in their ambient light office. We had a detailed walkthrough of the process of how radiologists browse and
        annotate multiple images in a scan and prepare a report. By the end of this meeting, we had a decent knowledge
        about radiologist’s workflow and PACS system
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Major user stories</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>User should be able to manage his worklists (group of scans)</li>
            <li>User should be able to upload a scan in system effortlessly</li>
            <li>User should be able to add patient in the system</li>
            <li>User should be able to select specific images to get AI result</li>
            <li>User should be able to add AI findings in a report</li>
            <li>User should be able to make a report based on findings in a scan</li>
            <li>User should be able to seek the help of colleagues in complex scenarios</li>
            <li>User should be able to compare two different images from the different scans of one patient</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design and iterations</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/wireframes.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Given the time of the project, we had to iterate on multiple flows and get quick feedback from all the
        stakeholders. We had few iterations of wireframe prototypes, where we quickly iterated on core user flows
        using Invision. Early feedback helped us in driving the design into the right direction. Having multiple radiologists in
        our stakeholder team was real asset for us.
    </p>

    <!-- Interaction design -->
    <!-- Worklists -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Worklists</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/worklists.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Worklists are a way for a users to manage multiple patient scans in groups. Worklists help users in staying
        focused on their work and hide all clutter. Users can make their custom worklists based on procedure they
        are expert in and scan priority.
    </p>

    <!-- Upload scan -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Upload scan</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/upload-scan.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        We broke down the upload scan process in 3 simple steps. Each scan must be assigned to the patient at the time
        of upload itself. We covered the scenario for a new patient and returning patient.
    </p>

    <!-- View and edit images -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: View and edit images</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/scan-view-1.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/scan-view-2.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/scan-view-4.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        We broke down all possible functionalities which can be performed on any scan into 5 categories. View/edit scan,
        AI result, reporting, seek opinion and patient documents. We had to make sure that radiologists should be able
        to scan through multiple images in very less time. Along with basic functionality which most PACS system has,
        where user can scroll on image to traverse through images on any specific plane (x, y or z) we also designed a
        gallery viewer. Gallery viewer can be expanded using a little toggle button at right, which also increases the
        thumbnail size.
    </p>

    <!-- Generating AI result -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Generating AI result</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/ai-result.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        AI engine designed by the team can go through a scan as a whole (all images) to predict the result, however,
        based on our discussion with stakeholders, we all agreed upon that radiologist should be able to choose specific
        images to get AI result. If they agree, they should be able to add findings to a user report.
    </p>

    <!-- Making patient report -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Making patient report</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/report.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        There are lots of interesting things happening all over Medo’s interface, like AI results, collaboration with
        colleagues and comparing scans but the final outcome is a simple report, which will be printed and handed over
        to the patient or email to Doctor. Reports have their own template based on the scan type.
    </p>

    <!-- Interaction design: Comparing report and images -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Comparing report and images</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/compare-image.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/medo/compare-report.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Comparison has immense value for radiologists, it makes their life much easier. They don’t have to look into
        multiple folders, plastic slides or printed papers to compare patient reports, in order to access health status.
    </p>

    <!-- Learnings -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Learnings</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        I had done a few projects related to physician appointment booking, queue management and others but Medo
        was much different and more complex project for me, where I got a chance to have a much deeper look into the Imaging world of healthcare industry.
        Doctor’s time and diagnosis accuracy have a paramount value in healthcare, this was the biggest learning for me.
        Little time wasted with fiddling interfaces can delay the patient’s report, which further can have a very unpleasant outcome.
