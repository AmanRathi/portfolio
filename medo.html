    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Medo is the platform which acts as an additional hand for radiologists by assisting them in diagnosing any possibilities of a condition by reading an ultrasound scan. Apart from it’s USP: AI it also does few basic activities which a normal PACS (Picture Archiving and communication system) does like viewing DICOM images, basic editing, annotating, report preparation,  image comparison and seeking colleagues opinion.

    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">The challenge</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        The biggest challenge I faced was my very limited knowledge about imaging technologies like Ultrasound or MRI. I had not much idea about the world of Radiologists, their day to day life and challenges faced by them. It was a little intimidating but exciting at the same time. Our client helped us in setting up a few quick meetings with his friend Radiologists in Pune at their labs. Information we got from these meetings was immensely useful and helped us throughout the project.

    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Goals</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        The major goals of the system were:
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>To simplify the use of ultrasound technology for common and critical conditions by using AI</li>
            <li>To assist users in complex cases. AI is great but there’s no substitute for human judgement. User should be able to seek the help of colleagues to reach on a better conclusion</li>
            <li>To generate a report for patients, so that software can be commercialized</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Getting along with users</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Our visit to Radiologists office helped us in observing their work environment closely. We spent half a day with our new friends in Pune in their ambient light office. Our client helped us in setting up this meeting with their connections in the city. We had a detailed walkthrough of the process of how radiologists browse and annotate multiple images in a scan and prepare a report. By the end of this meetup, we had a decent knowledge about radiologist’s workflow and PACS system

    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Major user stories</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>User should be able to manage his worklists (group of scans)</li>
            <li>User should be able to upload a scan in system effortlessly</li>
            <li>User should be able to add patient in the system</li>
            <li>User should be able to select specific images to get AI result</li>
            <li>User should be able to add AI findings in a report</li>
            <li>User should be able to make a report based on findings in a scan</li>
            <li>User should be able to seek the help of colleagues in complex images</li>
            <li>User should be able to compare two different images from the different scans of one patient</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design and iterations</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">

    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Given the time of the project, we will have to iterate on multiple flows and get quick feedback from our stakeholders. We had few iterations of wireframe prototypes, where we quickly iterated on crucial user flows using Invision. Early feedback helped us in driving the design in the right direction. Having 4 radiologists in our stakeholder team was real asset for us.
