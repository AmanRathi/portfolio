    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        In 2018 Summer, one evening few people were marketing about some service, at the entrance of our
        building. While I tried to avoid eye contact and pass through, a person called me politely
        “Sir may I have your 2 minutes”. Well in the next 2 minutes the gentleman convinced me thoroughly
        to use the service, it was an impressive pitch, at the right place and right time. Well I
        reached home, the first thing I did was to download the app and for next one hour I was
        lost in resolving the riddle. I was promised daily need groceries by the sales person
        but what I got is spaghetti.
    </p>

    <!-- About Raincan -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">About Raincan</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Raincan is Pune (India) based startup, who delivers daily need products like milk, bread,
        fruits or any sort of grocery at customer doorstep. The good thing about Raincan is, as
        a user you don’t have to place an order every week instead, user can select products,
        set frequency, select delivery time and goods are delivered at your doorstep. This is
        very useful in case of milk and dairy products (but not limited to) as a large number of
        Indian people consume milk and other dairy products on a regular basis.
    </p>

    <!-- First impression -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">First Impression of the app</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        First look at the app looked like a rough idea put together by the team, without
        thinking much about User Experience. Sometimes one has to figure out and get used to the
        poor design if the value of an idea is great, and there is no other alternative.
    </p>

    <!-- My Redesign process -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">My redesign process for Raincan design</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>Evaluate existing system</li>
            <li>User feedback</li>
            <li>Ideating new flow</li>
            <li>Visual design</li>
            <li>User feedback</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- Existing app flow -->
    <h2 class="col-8 d-content-main-heading">Existing app flows</h2>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        I had a detailed look at the app and functionality, also gathered the feedback of few
        of my friends using Raincan app. Below is the list of few areas of improvement I identified:
    </p>

    <!-- Onboarding -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Onboarding</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-onboarding.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Onboarding was straight forward, user enters his mobile number and validates via OTP.
        Only thing I complain about lot of apps that they force users to signup upfront, without
        even showing true value and offerings. Raincan had the same experience. User has to sign
        up without even knowing what categories they are serving, what kind of products and of what
        brand they are having.
    </p>

    <!-- Home page -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Home</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-home.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
        <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
            At first look, visuals didn’t look appealing, everything looked so congested, not much white space. Milk, as expected, had a priority 1 product, which occupied almost 80% of the screen, which didn’t look correct way to go. Here are a few of my findings of home page:
        <ul class="col-8 d-content-para d-list-content">
            <li>If you look at the horizontal milk list item at top, main call to action is Add to cart, whereas the core offering of the app is subscription.</li>
            <li>It’s very difficult to find out how to subscribe. Subscribe CTA looks like a label. Orange colour used for the same is having low contrast, which is not good from a usability standpoint. Tap area is also not sufficient.</li>
            <li>Product information can be viewed by tapping on the product picture. Which makes 3 different interactions on a small tile.</li>
            <li>From the first fold, it’s difficult to know what are the offerings of the platform, however, one good thing is, “Shop by category” label is visible in first fold which is good clue for a user</li>
            <li>Slight scroll shows the product categories, clipart is used for images, which looked a little old style but they served their purpose nicely.</li>
            <li>One thing which I believe should be there on the home page is information about products getting delivered today, and an easy way for users to raise if there’s any issue related to the delivery or quality. Once user has subscribed the products, more than updating the schedule he’ll be more concerned about the delivery and quality.</li>
            <li>Search could have a little bit more attention by using search bar instead search icon.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- Product listing -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Product listing and search results</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-product-listing.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        It is well said by someone less is more but that’s not the case with Raincan product listing page.
        They have tried to shove 9 results in one view. One major problem I see with this page is, product
        cards are not consistent across the app.
    </p>

    <!-- Subscription and schedule -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Subscription and schedule</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-subscription-schedule.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        There is no way for users to tell on what day a delivery is scheduled. The
        calendar does not show upfront if anything is getting delivered at specific day. User has to select
        a date to see what’s inside.
    </p>

    <!-- Product details -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Product details</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-product-details.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        When it comes to daily need products lots of users are very conscious about ingredients and nutrition information.
        Having those would be a good value addition. A dialog box does not seem to be an ideal chioce to show these details.
    </p>

    <!-- New design -->
    <h2 class="col-8 d-content-main-heading">New Design</h2>

    <!-- IA -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Information Architecture</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-ia.jpg" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        One of the core expectations of any system or product is discoverability. With Raincan app discoverability is not too bad that
        it can’t be used but certainly it is not user friendly. Managing your subscriptions, delivery schedule and balance
        should be little upfront than under my account. I made few changes in IA before getting dirty into the sketches.
    </p>

    <!-- Interaction design and wireframes -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Interaction design: Quick paper sketches</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-paper-sketches-1.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-paper-sketches-2.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        After gathering all insights from friends and my own review, I jumped into quick sketching based on IA I created.
        I tried a few different versions of some screens and compared with each other to finalise for visual design.
    </p>

    <!-- Visual design: Home page -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Visual design: Home</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-new-ui-home.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Given more priority to search and product categories. Now users can see their upcoming and last delivered products
        upfront, and in case of any delivery or quality issue raising a concern is easy. I Also brought wallet balance to the home
        screen considering adding a balance would be a frequent activity for user. Showing just a wallet balance might be
        useful in banking wallet apps but in this scenario there are recurring expenses. Showing users how long that balance
        will last will help them in taking wallet reload decision before time.
    </p>

    <!-- Visual design: Product listing -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Visual design: Product listing</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-new-ui-product-listing.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        I used a full width card for list items considering there are two action buttons and their labels. To keep UI clean and more
        scannable I kept button hidden by default, but used a small plus icon to invite user for further actions. One problem
        I saw with existing design was  user have to put little effort to understand things clear about subscription and one
        time buy pricing. I decided to put pricing for both inside buttons to make things straightforward.
    </p>

    <!-- Visual design: Subscribe products  -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Visual design: Subscribe a product</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-new-ui-subscribe-form.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
    </p>

    <!-- Visual design: Subscriptions and delivery schedule -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Visual design: Manage subscriptions and <br> delivery schedule</h3>
    <div class="col-10 d-image">
        <img src="images/raincan/raincan-new-ui-subscription-schedule.png" alt="sketches">
    </div>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Along with subscriptions I’ve decided to add 2 more components to this page, balance and delivery schedule. Based on the discussions
        and small card sorting activity with people using the app, it made sense to put delivery schedule under subscription.
        For delivery schedule instead using month calendar view I preferred weekly view as opposed to existing design, considering in most
        of the scenarios people plan for weeks instead of months. monthly view unnecessarily adds too much noise (big 30 cells grid).
        However I decided not kill the monthly view option completely, users can still access it by tapping on date, a little down arrow to indicate the same.
    </p>

    <!-- Learnings  -->
    <h3 class="col-8 d-content-heading">Learnings</h3>
    <p class="col-8 d-content-para">
        Having some design is better than no design. I can understand the scenarios where a young startup, having limited resources, building
        great ideas but design in most of these scenarios is an afterthought. Hiring a freelance designer for a brief time would be far better
        than having no designer at all. <br>
        Burning cash through online ads is not the only correct way to get downloads or more importantly active users. I loved the Raincan
        strategy of pitching ideas at the right location and the right time.
